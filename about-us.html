        <p> The CFX vision has always been of a full-service forex experience, ranging from fully-automated participation in the forex market for its global membership.</p>
       </span>
         
         <p>Members with the desire to partially or fully immerse themselves into learning, and ultimately mastering the Foreign Exchange market will be able to do so with the support of 2 key infrastructural CFX tools: The CFX Academy and the CFX corporate offices in Panama City, Panama.</p>
         
        <p> While the Academy contains forex focused curriculum from beginner through advance to expert in 3 interactive learning series, the Elemental, Advanced, and Supreme, this is far from the limit of benefit to CFX membership.</p>
         
     </div>

    <div class="div2">
     <span> <p>As a custom-designed and built online environment, the Academy of the future will also serve as the foundation of financial learning for hundreds of thousands of members worldwide.</p></span>
     
     <p>As the wealth divide between financial classes continues to expand, in western countries, it is becoming obvious that most people are not learning the very basics of understanding assets and asset management, opportunities that are available to them and using sound financial principles to create financial security for themselves and their families.</p>
     
     <p>As an extension to the CFX Academy, large-scale global financial events are also planned to extend the opportunity for CFX members to meet each other, develop friendships and learn from financial experts in a variety of critically important wealthy building subjects.</p>

<h3>Always Win Strategy</h3>
<span>Copy Trading is an innovative tool used in the Foreign Exchange market (Forex).</span>

<p>It can also be referred to as social trading and is accomplished by connecting an individual’s personal trading account to an authorized master trading account using the same broker.</p>

<p>Every forex trade made by the master account is immediately made in all connected individual accounts, all while individual trade capital remains in full control of each account holder.
</p>

<p>For this reason, the tool is commonly known as “Copy Trading”.</p>

 </div>
 <br>
<div class="advantages">
  <h2>Advantages of access to successful Copy Trading</h2>

<p>
  There are two significant advantages to access of a successful Copy Trading master trader.
</p>


<p><strong>The first,
</strong>
and most obvious is that the individual account holder is not required to do any trading activity themselves. One may participate in Copy Trading with absolutely no trading experience. The master account executes all trades.</p>

<p><strong>
The second,
</strong>significant advantage is if an individual has access to a highly skilled master account to do their Copy Trading for them. This is not as easy as one may think. Highly skilled traders and proven trade strategies are not easy to access. Trade history and experience are especially important.
</p>
<br>
<strong>
  This is undoubtedly the simplest way to receive signals and execute trades. To be connected, simply select a broker that offers Copy Trading, follow the proper broker registration process, fund your account, and connect your individual trading account to the master trading account wish to follow. Things in the forex world don’t get any simpler than that.
